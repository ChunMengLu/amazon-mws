 * This is the Merchant Fulfillment API section of the Marketplace Web Service.  It allows clients to view shipping services that meet the specific criteria.  Also, it allows clients to create shipments that result in a shipping label being generated (and paid for by the seller).  Lastly, clients can cancel the label and according to different carrier rules get refunds for their unused labels.
